# Palindrome_LinkedList_Problem
This Java program checks whether a singly linked list is a palindrome (reads the same forward and backward). It uses a stack (Deque) to reverse the order of elements and compares them to the original list values.
Time Complexity: O(n)
First traversal (pushing onto stack):
You visit each node once → O(n)

Second traversal (comparing with stack):
Again, you visit each node once → O(n)
